# JMA_land_dev

## Requirement
The model runs on NetLogo 5.3. 

## Introduction
This is a repository of my PhD project on modelling the urban growth pattern using Agent-based modelling approach. The urban simulation models aim to improve our understanding on how various type of private developers influence the urban development, land values, and land pattern of megacity like Jakarta Metropolitan Area (JMA), Indonesia.

There are two models in this repository with each represents
1. Introducing the concept of micro-conomic that links the profit oriented developer with the spatial impact that it created.
2. Simulating various types (small, medium, and large) developers with capital as the main differentiation. The link to full paper is here. https://res.mdpi.com/mwg-internal/de5fs23hu73ds/progress?id=-k7oiaNW5wt5PC7RocltpWkMY3EzLH5Z5B3UOgujSFM,

Commonality on both models, are the four main steps that developer (as an agent) needs to get through in the model;
### 1. Land search
Developer search for available land.

### 2. Land analysis
The developer do profit analysis assessment on the selected land. Depending on the capital availability and the potential generated profit of the land, the developer selects the land.

### 3. Land decision
Developer decided to stay to develop the land, or leave the land.

### 4. Land action
Developer develops the land into urban. As a consequence, land cover changes from non-urban into urban and land values on the developed lands and  the surrounding increase.
